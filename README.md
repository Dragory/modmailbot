# Modmail for Discord
A bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) that allows users to DM the bot to contact the server's entire mod team.
These DMs get relayed to a modmail server where each user gets their own channel, or "thread".
Moderators and admins can then reply to these threads, and these responses are relayed back to the original user as a DM.

Inspired by Reddit's modmail system.

## NOTE! If you're upgrading to v2.23.0, note that Node.js 10 is now required at minimum.

2. Download the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot/releases)
3. Create a Discord server to be used as the modmail inbox
4. Make a copy of the file `config.example.json` in the same folder and name the copy `config.json`. Open the file and fill in the values.
   - You can also find more configurable options at the end of this page!
5. Install dependencies: `npm ci`
6. Add bot to servers, and make sure to give it proper permissions on the mail server.
7. Run the bot: `npm start`

## Commands

### Anywhere on the inbox server
`!logs <user> <page>` Lists previous modmail logs with the specified user. If there are a lot of logs, they will be paginated. In this case, you can specify the page number to view as the second argument.  
`!block <user> <time>` Blocks the specified user from using modmail. If a time is specified, the block is temporary.  
`!unblock <user> <time>` Unblocks the specified user from using modmail. If a time is specified, the user will be scheduled to be unblocked after that time.  
`!is_blocked <user>` Checks whether the user is blocked and for how long  
`!s <shortcut> <text>` Adds a snippet (a canned response). Supports {1}, {2}, etc. for arguments. See below for how to use it.  
`!edit_snippet <shortcut> <text>` Edits an existing snippet (alias `!es`)  
`!delete_snippet <shortcut>` Deletes the specified snippet (alias `!ds`)  
`!snippets` Lists all available snippets  
`!version` Print the version of the bot you're running  
`!newthread <user>` Opens a new thread with the specified user

### Inside a modmail thread
`!reply <text>` Sends a reply to the user in the format "(Role) User: text" (alias `!r`)  
`!anonreply <text>` Sends an anonymous reply to the user in the format "Role: text" (alias `!ar`)  
`!close <time>` Closes the modmail thread. If a time is specified, the thread is scheduled to be closed later. Scheduled closing is cancelled if a message is sent to or received from the user.  
`!logs <page>` Lists previous modmail logs with this user. If there are a lot of logs, they will be paginated. In this case, you can specify the page number to view as an argument.  
`!block <time>` Blocks the user from using modmail. If a time is specified, the block is temporary.  
`!unblock <time>` Unblocks the user from using modmail. If a time is specified, the user will be scheduled to be unblocked after that time.  
`!!shortcut` Reply with a snippet. Replace `shortcut` with the snippet's actual shortcut.  
`!!!shortcut` Reply with a snippet anonymously. Replace `shortcut` with the snippet's actual shortcut.  
`!move <category>` If `allowMove` is enabled, moves the thread channel to the specified category  
`!loglink` Shows the link to the current thread's log  
`!suspend` Suspend a thread. The thread will act as closed and not receive any messages until unsuspended.  
`!unsuspend` Unsuspend a thread  
`!id` Prints the user's ID
`!alert` Pings you when the thread gets a new reply. Use `!alert cancel` to cancel.

To automatically reply without using !reply or !r, enable `alwaysReply` in the config. `alwaysReplyAnon` sets whether to reply anonymously. If you do not wish to reply, it will ignore any message starting in the prefix (which defaults to !), such as !note

## Plugins
The bot supports loading external plugins.

### Specifying plugins to load
Add the path to the plugin's file to the `plugins` array in the config.
The plugin will be automatically loaded on startup.
The path is relative to the bot's folder.

### Creating a plugin
Create a `.js` file that exports a function.
This function will be called when the plugin is loaded with an object that has the following properties:
* `bot` - the [Eris Client object](https://abal.moe/Eris/docs/Client)
* `knex` - the [Knex database object](https://knexjs.org/#Builder)
* `config` - the loaded config
* `commands` - an object with functions to add and manage commands
* `attachments` - an object with functions to save attachments and manage attachment storage types

See [src/plugins.js#L4](src/plugins.js#L4) for more details

#### Example plugin file
This example adds a command `!mycommand` that replies with `"Reply from my custom plugin!"` when the command is used inside a modmail inbox thread channel.
```js
module.exports = function({ bot, knex, config, commands }) {
  commands.addInboxThreadCommand('mycommand', [], (msg, args, thread) => {
    thread.replyToUser(msg.author, 'Reply from my custom plugin!');
  });
}
```

(Note the use of [object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Unpacking_fields_from_objects_passed_as_function_parameter) in the function parameters)

#### Example of a custom attachment storage type
This example adds a custom type for the `attachmentStorage` option called `"original"` that simply returns the original attachment URL without rehosting it in any way.
```js
module.exports = function({ attachments }) {
  attachments.addStorageType('original', attachment => {
    return { url: attachment.url };
  });
};
```
To use this custom attachment storage type, you would set the `attachmentStorage` config option to `"original"`. 

### Work in progress
The current plugin API is fairly rudimentary and will be expanded in the future.
The API can change in non-major releases during this early stage. Keep an eye on [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for any changes.

Please send any feature suggestions to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot/issues)!
