# ðŸ§© Plugins
The bot supports loading external plugins.

## Specifying plugins to load
Plugins can be loaded either from local files or NPM. Examples:
```ini
# Local file
plugins[] = ./path/to/plugin.js
# NPM package
plugins[] = npm:some-plugin-package
```
Paths to local files are always relative to the bot's folder.
NPM plugins are automatically installed on bot start-up.

## Creating a plugin
Plugins are simply `.js` files that export a function that gets called when the plugin is loaded.

For details about the function arguments, see [Plugin API](#plugin-api) below.

### Example plugin
This example adds a command `!mycommand` that replies with `"Reply from my custom plugin!"` when the command is used inside a modmail inbox thread channel.
```js
module.exports = function({ bot, knex, config, commands }) {
  commands.addInboxThreadCommand('mycommand', [], (msg, args, thread) => {
    thread.replyToUser(msg.member, 'Reply from my custom plugin!');
  });
}
```

(Note the use of [object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Unpacking_fields_from_objects_passed_as_function_parameter) in the function parameters)

### Example of a custom attachment storage type
This example adds a custom type for the `attachmentStorage` option called `"original"` that simply returns the original attachment URL without rehosting it in any way.
```js
module.exports = function({ attachments }) {
  attachments.addStorageType('original', attachment => {
    return { url: attachment.url };
  });
};
```
To use this custom attachment storage type, you would set the `attachmentStorage` config option to `"original"`.

### Example of a custom log storage type
This example adds a custom type for the `logStorage` option called `"pastebin"` that uploads logs to Pastebin.

```js
module.exports = function({ logs, formatters }) {
  logs.addStorageType('pastebin', {
    async save(thread, threadMessages) {
      const formatLogResult = await formatters.formatLog(thread, threadMessages);
      const pastebinUrl = await saveToPastebin(formatLogResult); // saveToPastebin is an example function that returns the pastebin URL for the saved log
      return { url: pastebinUrl };
    },

    getUrl(thread) {
      return thread.log_storage_data.url;
    }
  });
};
```

### Plugin API
The first and only argument to the plugin function is an object with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `bot` | [Eris Client instance](https://abal.moe/Eris/docs/Client) |
| `knex` | [Knex database object](https://knexjs.org/#Builder) |
| `config` | The loaded config |
| `commands` | An object with functions to add and manage commands |
| `attachments` | An object with functions to save attachments and manage attachment storage types |
| `logs` | An object with functions to get attachment URLs/files and manage log storage types |
| `hooks` | An object with functions to add *hooks* that are called at specific times, e.g. before a new thread is created |
| `formats` | An object with functions that allow you to replace the default functions used for formatting messages and logs |
| `webserver` | An [Express Application object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app) that functions as the bot's web server |
| `threads` | An object with functions to find and create threads |
| `displayRoles` | An object with functions to set and get moderators' display roles |

See the auto-generated [Plugin API](plugin-api.md) page for details.

## Plugin API stability
Bot releases may contain changes to the plugin API. Make sure to check the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading!
