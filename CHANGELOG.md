# Changelog

## v2.27.0
* The `syncPermissionsOnMove` option now defaults to `true`, which should be more intuitive
* **Plugins:** Plugin functions are no longer called with 4 arguments. Instead, the function is called with 1 argument,
which is an object that contains the previous 4 values as properties: `bot`, `knex`, `config`, `commands`.
This will make it easier to scale the plugin system in the future with new features.
You can see an [updated example in the README](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot/blob/master/README.md#example-plugin-file).

## v2.26.0
* The bot now waits for the main server(s) and inbox server to become available before initializing.
This is a potential fix to [#335](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot/issues/335).
This should have little to no effect on smaller servers.
* The bot status ("Playing") is now reapplied hourly since the status can sometimes disappear

## v2.25.0
* Fix regression introduced in v2.24.0 where line breaks would get turned to spaces in replies and snippets ([#304](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot/issues/304))
* Replace the internal command handler with a new one. This should be fairly thoroughly tested, but please report any issues you encounter!
* Plugins are now called with a fourth parameter that allows you to easily add specific types of commands
  * Due to the command handler change, any calls to `bot.registerCommand` should be replaced with the new system

## v2.24.0
* Switch to the new stable version of Eris (0.10.0) instead of the dev version

## v2.23.2
* Update Node.js version check at startup to require Node.js 10

## v2.23.1
* Updated required Node.js version in .nvmrc and README (v10 is now the minimum)

## v2.23.0
* Add update notifications. The bot will check for new versions every 12 hours and notify moderators at the top of new
modmail threads when there are new versions available. Can be disabled by setting the `updateNotifications` option to `false`.
New available versions are also shown in `!version`.
  * If you have forked the repository and want to check for updates in your own repository instead,
  change the `repository` value in `package.json`
* Add basic support for plugins. See the **Plugins** section in README for more information.
* Add support for snippet arguments. To use these, put {1}, {2}, etc. in the snippet text and they will be replaced by the given arguments when using the snippet.
* Add support for multiple `mentionRole` config option values in an array
* Add `commandAliases` config option to set custom command aliases
* Add support for timed blocks. Simply specify the duration as the last argument in `!block` or `!unblock`.
* Add pagination to `!logs`

## v2.22.0
* Add `guildGreetings` option to allow configuring greeting messages on a per-server basis
* Add `rolesInThreadHeader` option to show the user's roles in the modmail thread's header

## v2.21.3
* Fix crash caused by Nitro Boosting notifications

## v2.21.2
* Update Eris to fix crashes with news channels and nitro boosting

## v2.21.1
* "Account age" and "time on server" requirements are now ignored when using `!newthread`

## v2.21.0
* Add `requiredTimeOnServer` and `timeOnServerDeniedMessage` config options to restrict modmail from users who have just joined the server. Thanks [@reboxer](https://github.com/reboxer) ([#270](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot/pull/270))!

## v2.20.0
* Add `categoryAutomation` option to automate thread categories. Currently supported sub-options:
  * `newThread` - same as `newThreadCategoryId`, the default category for new threads
  * `newThreadFromGuild` - default category on a per-guild basis, value is an object with guild IDs as keys and category IDs as values 
* Threads should now include member information (nickname, joined at, etc.) more reliably
* Thread header now also includes the member's current voice channel, if any

## v2.19.0
* Add `attachmentStorage` option to control where attachments are saved. Currently supported:
  * `"local"` (default) - Same as before: attachments are saved locally on the machine running the bot and served through the bot's web server
  * `"discord"` - Attachments are saved on a special Discord channel specified by the `attachmentStorageChannelId` option
* Add `syncPermissionsOnMove` option. When enabled, thread channel permissions are synced with the category when the thread is moved with `!move`.
* Add support for scheduling `!suspend`. Works the same way as with `!close`, just specify the time after the command. Can be cancelled with `!suspend cancel`.
* Scheduled `!close` can now be silent - just add `silent` as an argument to the command before or after the schedule time
* The schedule time format for `!close` is now stricter and times with whitespace (e.g. `2 h 30 m`) no longer work. Use e.g. `2h30m` instead.
* `!loglink` can now be used in suspended threads
* User can now be mentioned in `botMentionResponse` by adding `{userMention}` to the response text. Thanks @reboxer (#225)!
* Fixed a small mistake in README, thanks @GabrielLewis2 (#226)!

## v2.18.0
* Add `silent` option to `!close` (e.g. `!close silent`) to close threads without sending the specified `closeMessage`
* Update some package versions (may help with sqlite3 install issues)

## v2.17.0
* Add `mentionUserInThreadHeader` option. When set to `true`, mentions the thread's user in the thread header. Fixes #152.
* Add `botMentionResponse` option. If set, the bot auto-responds to bot mentions with this message. Fixes #143.
* Fix member info sometimes missing in thread header. Thanks @Akhawais (#136)! 
* Add support for role and user IDs in inboxServerPermission instead of just permission names
* Allow specifying multiple values (an array) for inboxServerPermission. Members will be considered "staff" if they pass any of the values.
* Update Eris to 0.9.0, Knex to 0.15.2
* Add support for sending anonymous snippets. By default, you can do this by using `!!!` instead of `!!`. Fixes #82.
* Add `snippetPrefixAnon` option
* Add `allowUserClose` option. When set to `true`, users can use the close command to close threads by themselves.
* Fix `allowMove` missing from README. Thanks @AndreasGassmann (#126)!

## v2.16.0
* Add support for a .js config file (export config with `module.exports`)

## v2.15.2
* Update several other packages as well

## v2.15.1

## v2.11.1
* Fixed greetings not being sent since multi-server support was added in 2.9.0

## v2.11.0
* Config files are now parsed using [JSON5](https://json5.org/), allowing you to use comments, trailing commas, and other neat things in your config.json
* When using multiple main guilds, the originating guild name is now always included at the top of the thread (if possible).
Previously, if the user that messaged modmail was on only one of the guilds, the guild name would not be shown at the top.
* Fixed crash when a user edited a message in their DMs with modmail without an open thread
* Small fixes to category name matching when using `!move`
* Fixed crash when the bot was unable to send an auto-response to a user
* Added option `pingOnBotMention` (defaults to `true`) that allows you to control whether staff are pinged when the bot is mentioned
* Long messages are now chunked so they don't fail to send due to added length from e.g. user name

## v2.10.1
* Changed timed close default unit from seconds to minutes.
This means that doing e.g. `!close 30` now closes the thread in 30 *minutes*, not seconds.

## v2.10.0

Using `!alert` in a modmail thread will ping you the next time the thread gets a new reply.
Use `!alert cancel` to cancel.

## v2.9.1

Nickname and join date will be displayed for each main guild the user is in.
* Information posted at the top of modmail threads now also includes time since the user joined the guild(s)
* Added `!id`  
`!id` posts the user ID of the current thread. Useful on mobile when you need to get the user ID.
* Added `!newthread`  
`!newthread <userid>` opens a new thread with the specified user
* Fixed a crash when the bot was unable to send a greeting message due to the user's privacy options

## v2.2.0
* Added the ability to schedule a thread to close by specifying a time after `!close`, e.g. `!close 1h`. The scheduling is cancelled if a new message is sent to or received from the user.

## v2.1.0
* Added typing proxy ([#48](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot/pull/48)):
  * If the `typingProxy` config option is enabled, any time a user is typing to modmail in their DMs, the modmail thread will show the bot as "typing" 
  * If the `typingProxyReverse` config option is enabled, any time a moderator is typing in a modmail thread, the user will see the bot "typing" in their DMs

## v2.0.1
* The link to the current thread's log is no longer posted to the top of the thread. Use `!loglink` instead.

## v2.0.0
* Rewrote large parts of the code to be more modular and maintainable. There may be some new bugs because of this - please report them through GitHub issues if you encounter any!
* Threads, logs, and snippets are now stored in an SQLite database. The bot will migrate old data on the first run.
* Small attachments (<2MB) from users can now be relayed as Discord attachments in the modmail thread with the `relaySmallAttachmentsAsAttachments` config option. Logs will have the link as usual.
* Fixed system messages like pins in DMs being relayed to the thread
* Fixed channels sometimes being created without a category even when `newThreadCategoryId` was set
* Removed timestamps from threads by default. Logs will still have accurate timestamps. Can be re-enabled with the `threadTimestamps` config option.
* Added `!move` command to move threads between categories. Can be enabled with the `allowMove` config option, disabled by default.

## Sep 19, 2017
* Added `logChannelId` option
* Some code clean-up. Please open an issue if you encounter any bugs!
* The bot now throws an error for unknown options in `config.json` (assuming they're typos) and tells you if you haven't configured the token or mail guild id.

## Aug 3, 2017
* Fixed user nicknames not showing in new threads
* The "manageRoles" permission is no longer required to use commands on the inbox server.  
This can be configured with the `inboxServerPermission` config option.

## July 24, 2017
* Commands are now case-insensitive (so !close, !Close, and !CLOSE all work)
* The before/after prefixes in edit notifications are now the same length, making it easier to spot the edited part
* Non-ASCII names should now result in better channel names (not just "unknown")

## May 18, 2017
* Identical edits are now ignored
* New thread notification (with @ here ping) is now posted in the thread instead of the inbox server default channel
* Thread close notifications no longer ping the user who closed the thread
* Received attachments are now only linked once the bot has saved them (should fix embeds)
* Replies now use your nickname, if any
* Several messages are now ignored for thread creation ("ok", "thanks", and similar)
* Logs from !logs are now sorted in descending order (newest first)

## Feb 15, 2017
